# ✅ Jekyll Automation Complete!

Your site is now **fully automated**. Here's what changed:

## What's Now Automatic

### 1. Sitemap Generation
- **Before**: Manual `sitemap.xml` file you had to update
- **After**: Auto-generated by `jekyll-sitemap` plugin
- **File**: Deleted manual sitemap, Jekyll creates it at build time
- **You do**: Nothing! Just write posts and push

### 2. Related Posts
- **Before**: Manual "Related Articles" sections in each post
- **After**: Auto-generated based on matching categories and tags
- **Logic**: Matches posts with same category (2 points) + matching tags (1 point each)
- **Fallback**: Shows recent posts if no category/tag matches
- **You do**: Just add `category` and `tags` to frontmatter

### 3. Homepage Article Listings
- **Before**: Manually list every article on index.md
- **After**: Can use includes to auto-generate by category
- **Available includes**:
  - `{% include posts-by-category.html %}` - All posts grouped by category
  - `{% include article-grid.html %}` - Grid layout of posts
- **You do**: Optionally replace manual lists with includes

### 4. RSS Feed (Bonus!)
- **New feature**: Auto-generated RSS feed at `/feed.xml`
- **Why**: Allows people to subscribe to your blog
- **You do**: Nothing, it's automatic

## New Jekyll Plugins Added

In `_config.yml`:
```yaml
plugins:
  - jekyll-seo-tag       # Already had this
  - jekyll-sitemap       # NEW - Auto sitemap
  - jekyll-feed          # NEW - Auto RSS feed
```

## How Related Posts Work Now

The post layout (`_layouts/post.html`) now automatically:
1. Finds posts with same category (+2 relevance points)
2. Finds posts with matching tags (+1 point per tag)
3. Sorts by relevance score
4. Shows top 4 most related posts
5. Falls back to recent posts if none match

**No more manual "Related Articles" sections needed!**

## Frontmatter Template for New Articles

When you create a new article, use this template:

```yaml
---
layout: post
title: "Your Article Title"
description: "150-160 char description for SEO"
keywords: "keyword1, keyword2, keyword3"
author: "Generalist Programmer"
category: "Technical Guides"  # or "Case Studies" or "Product Guides"
tags: ["tag1", "tag2", "tag3", "tag4"]  # For related posts matching
date: 2025-11-18
read_time: 10
modified: 2025-11-18
canonical_url: "https://generalistprogrammer.github.io/article-name.html"
robots: "index, follow"
---
```

**Important**: The `category` and `tags` fields are key for automatic related posts!

## What You Can Remove

You can now **delete the manual "Related Articles" sections** from your .md files since they're auto-generated in the layout. But keeping them won't hurt - the layout version will just override them.

Files with manual sections you can clean up:
- All 13 article .md files (at the bottom)

## Files Created

- `_includes/related-posts.html` - Related posts component (not currently used, layout has inline version)
- `_includes/article-grid.html` - Article grid component for homepage
- `_includes/posts-by-category.html` - Category-grouped posts component
- `AUTOMATION_GUIDE.md` - Full documentation on how automation works
- `AUTOMATION_SUMMARY.md` - This file

## Testing the Automation

To see it work locally:
```bash
gem install bundler jekyll
jekyll serve
# Visit http://localhost:4000
```

Check:
- `/sitemap.xml` - Should be auto-generated
- `/feed.xml` - Should be auto-generated
- Any article page - Should show related posts at bottom

## Next Steps

1. **Optional**: Remove manual "Related Articles" sections from .md files
2. **Optional**: Replace manual homepage lists with {% include posts-by-category.html %}
3. **Push to GitHub**: Everything will work on GitHub Pages
4. **Submit sitemap**: Add https://generalistprogrammer.github.io/sitemap.xml to Google Search Console

## Adding New Articles (Simple!)

1. Create `new-article.md` in root directory
2. Add frontmatter with `category` and `tags`
3. Write content
4. `git push`
5. **Done!** Everything else happens automatically:
