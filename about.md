## Our Editorial Standards

We maintain strict editorial standards to ensure our content is valuable, accurate, and trustworthy:

**Research-Driven:** Every article is backed by either direct experience, industry research, or interviews with practitioners. We cite our sources and link to primary materials whenever possible.

**Practical Over Theoretical:** We prioritize actionable advice over abstract concepts. If you can't implement it within your organization, we don't publish it.

**Experience-Based:** Our writers draw from real-world experience building and leading technology teams. We share what actually works, not what sounds good in theory.

**No Vendor Bias:** We maintain editorial independence. Our technical recommendations are based on merit, not marketing relationships.

**Continuous Updates:** Technology evolves rapidly. We regularly review and update our most popular articles to ensure they remain current and accurate.

## Transparency & Disclosures

**Affiliate Relationships:** Some articles may include affiliate links to books, courses, or tools we genuinely recommend. These are clearly marked, and we only recommend products our team has personally used and found valuable. Affiliate commissions never influence our editorial decisions.

**Sponsored Content:** We occasionally publish sponsored content from carefully selected partners. All sponsored posts are clearly labeled and must meet our editorial quality standards. Sponsors do not receive editorial control over content.

**No Pay-for-Play:** We do not accept payment for positive coverage, reviews, or inclusion in our articles. All recommendations are based solely on merit and relevance to our readers.

## Our Readers

Generalist Programmer serves technology leaders who are responsible for both technical and business outcomes:

- CTOs and VPs of Engineering at startups and scale-ups
- Engineering Managers transitioning into senior leadership
- Senior engineers considering management tracks
- Technical founders building their first teams
- Product Managers working closely with engineering

Our readers value depth over breadth, prefer substance over hype, and want advice they can implement Monday morning.

## Why "Generalist Programmer"?

The name reflects our philosophy: the best technology leaders are T-shaped professionals—deep expertise in specific areas combined with broad knowledge across the stack.

As you move into leadership, being a specialist in one language or framework becomes less important than understanding systems thinking, architectural tradeoffs, and how technology choices impact business outcomes.

We're here to help you develop that generalist mindset while maintaining the depth that makes you effective.
